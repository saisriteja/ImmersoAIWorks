# Image Annotation Generation

## Overview

This tool generates image annotations by analyzing images in a provided folder and creating captions for each image. The result is saved in a JSON format, which includes metadata and captions for each image.

## Input

- **Image Folder**: The folder containing the images you want to annotate.
- **Output JSON Path**: The location where the resulting JSON file will be saved.

## Output

The output will be a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "model_name": "Your Model Name",
    "time_taken": "Time Taken to Process (in seconds)",
    "total_no_of_images": "Total Number of Images Processed"
  },
  "captions": {
    "framepath1": "Caption for frame 1",
    "framepath2": "Caption for frame 2",
    "framepath3": "Caption for frame 3",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **metadata**:

   - **modelname**: The name of the model used for generating captions.
   - **timetaken**: The time taken to process the images and generate the captions.
   - **totalnoofimages**: The total number of images that were processed in the input folder.

2. **captions**:
   - The keys in this section represent the file paths of the images (e.g., `framepath1` refers to the first image's path).
   - The values are the corresponding captions generated for each image.

## Example

Input:

- Image Folder: `./images`
- Output JSON Path: `./output/annotations.json`

Sample output:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "model_name": "ImageCaptioningV2",
    "time_taken": "12.5",
    "total_no_of_images": 5
  },
  "captions": {
    "./images/image1.jpg": "A group of people at a park",
    "./images/image2.jpg": "A dog running on the beach",
    "./images/image3.jpg": "A man standing by a mountain",
    "./images/image4.jpg": "A close-up of a flower",
    "./images/image5.jpg": "A sunset over the ocean"
  }
}
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:

   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., Python libraries for image processing and model inference).

2. **Run the Script**:

   - Pass the path to the image folder and the desired output path for the JSON file as arguments.
   - The script will process all the images in the provided folder and generate captions for each one.

3. **View the Output**:
   - The generated JSON file will contain metadata and captions for each image, which can be used for further analysis or storage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (e.g., image processing libraries, deep learning models for captioning)
