### Video Annotation Process Using LLMs for Frame-by-Frame Captioning

In this scenario, we are leveraging image captions for each frame in a video and using a language model (LLM) to summarize the content between timestamps. The process generates detailed captions for each frame, which are then used by the LLM to provide a concise summary of the video content.

The following is the format and workflow that the system follows:

#### **Input**

- **Frames**: The video is split into individual frames, and each frame is processed as an image to generate captions.
- **Frame Number**: The frame number is extracted from the image filename (before the file extension).
- **Captioning**: Each frame is analyzed by the image captioning model, generating a description of the scene.
- **LLM Summarization**: After captioning all frames, an LLM model (like LLAVA or GPT-based models) is used to summarize the entire sequence of frames based on their timestamps.

#### **Expected JSON Format**

The generated JSON structure will have two main sections: `metadata` and `captions`.

1. **Metadata**: Contains information about the model used and the process.
2. **Captions**: Each frame (identified by its filename) will have a corresponding caption describing its content.

{
  "metadata": {
    "model_name": "llava-llama3",
    "time_taken": 0.39,
    "total_no_of_images": 6
  },
  "captions": {
    "sample_images/315.jpg": "The image captures a dynamic scene of a dust storm. The main focus is on the right side of the image, where a dark brown pile of dirt is being stirred up by an unseen object or person. The action creates a cloud of dust that billows towards the left side of the image. The background is blurred, drawing attention to the pile of dirt and the flying dust particles. There are no discernible texts or countable objects in the image. The relative positions of the objects suggest movement from right to left, with the dust particles following the path created by the stirrer.",
    "sample_images/314.jpg": "The image captures a dynamic scene of a person standing behind a white screen. The individual is blurred, suggesting motion or swift action, adding a sense of urgency to the moment. The background is dark, providing a stark contrast that further emphasizes the subject in the foreground. The colors are predominantly muted, with the exception of the white screen and a streak of brown light emanating from it, which stands out against the otherwise subdued palette. This light could possibly represent a laser beam or another form of intense illumination.",
    "sample_images/317.jpg": "In the center of a grand room, a group of people dressed in traditional attire are gathered around a golden chalice. The chalice, gleaming under the soft light filtering through large windows, is held aloft by two individuals standing on either side of it. Their faces are turned towards the camera, their expressions filled with anticipation and reverence.",
    "sample_images/311.jpg": "In the image, a man is standing in front of a group of people who are all wearing red turbans. The man is adorned with traditional Indian attire, including a gold necklace and earrings that glint under the light. A red headdress, similar to those worn by the crowd behind him, rests on his head.",
    "sample_images/316.jpg": "In the center of the image, a man stands out in his traditional Indian attire. He is adorned with a large pink turban that contrasts sharply with his white shirt and gold necklace. His mustache is well-groomed, adding to his dignified appearance.",
    "sample_images/312.jpg": "The image captures a moment of quiet reflection. A man, bald and seemingly deep in thought, stands in a room that exudes an air of solemnity. He is clad in a white shirt, its pristine color contrasting with the muted tones of his surroundings."

### **Explanation of JSON Structure**:

- **`metadata`**:

  - **`model_name`**: The name of the model used for captioning (e.g., `"llava-llama3"`).
  - **`time_taken`**: The total time (in seconds) taken to process the images and generate the captions.
  - **`total_no_of_images`**: The total number of frames (images) processed from the video.

- **`captions`**:
  - Each key in this section corresponds to an image path (e.g., `"sample_images/315.jpg"`) derived from the frame number of the video.
  - The value is the caption generated for that specific image.

### **Workflow Overview**:

1. **Extract Frames**: The video is processed frame by frame. Each frame is saved as an image.
2. **Generate Captions**: Each image is passed through the image captioning model (e.g., `"llava-llama3"`), which generates a detailed description of the scene in the image.
3. **Summarize the Frames**: Using a language model, a summary of the video is generated based on the captions and their timestamps. This summary can be used for generating video annotations or scene breakdowns.
